# Climate Impact Rating (CIR) Server

This is a PoC of an API server to manage Climate Impact data for products, for the 2020
[Call-For-Code](https://callforcode.org/), from the [Energy Sustainability
team](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/solution-starter-kit-energy-2020).

This is intended as an example to enable experimentation, as described in the main [README](../README.md).

## Next goals of this code repo

* more complete API support
* include geo-summary data
* implement example climate rating algorithms, that summarize the impact of a product
